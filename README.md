# the-algorithm-design

This is a project with the aim to explore, improve and implement some basic and complex algorithms in Python.

There are three desirable properties for a good algorithm. We seek algorithms that are correct and **efficient**, while being **easy to implement**. These goals may not be simultaneously achievable.
